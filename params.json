If you have RSpec, it can use that,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nanaltester will look through your ./lib directory and create corresponding tests in test/.\r\nThey will all fail, until you write them. Use it to quickly populate an untested\r\nlibrary with tests. Just run `analtester` from the command-line in your project's root.\r\n\r\nRequires minitest, unless it doesn't.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n    $ gem install analtester\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    $ cd myproject\r\n    $ analtest -h\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjjb/analtester.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjjb/analtester)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
